# Easy Ender Additions
Fabric Mod for Minecraft 1.20.1

Easy Ender Additions is a progression focused mod designed to make Ender and Blaze resources obtainable through mining, processing, and automation. It is especially useful for players who play on Peaceful difficulty or who prefer tech based progression over mob farming.

Instead of hunting Endermen or farming Blazes, players can now mine special ores, refine them into fragments, and craft or automate their way to Ender Pearls and Blaze Powder.

## Ender Ores

Easy Ender adds three Ender Ore variants.

They all:
- Require an Iron pickaxe or better
- Support Silk Touch
- Drop Ender Fragments
- Give experience when mined

### Ender Ore (Overworld)
Spawns between Y -64 and Y 12  
Vein size: 3  
Veins per chunk: 5  
Drops 0.2 XP

### Deepslate Ender Ore
Spawns in the deepslate layers and behaves the same as Ender Ore

### End Ender Ore
Spawns in The End  
Vein size: 8  
Veins per chunk: 25

## Blaze Ores

- Require an Iron pickaxe or better
- Support Silk Touch
- Drop Blaze Fragments
- Give experience when mined

## Fragments and Dust

### Ender Fragments
Obtained by mining Ender Ore or smelting Ender Dust.  
9 Ender Fragments can be crafted into 1 Ender Pearl.

They can also be eaten. Doing so will teleport the player randomly (within loaded chunks), play Enderman effects, deal Ender Pearl style damage, apply nausea for 10 seconds, and cannot kill the player. This can get you out of trouble at a drop of a hat.

### Blaze Fragments
Obtained by mining Blaze Ore or smelting Blaze Dust.  
9 Blaze Fragments craft into vanilla Blaze Powder.

### Ender Dust and Blaze Dust
Dusts are created by washing slurry or by milling fragments.  
Dust can be smelted or blasted into fragments.

---

## Slurry and Automation

When using Create or similar tech mods:

Crushing Ender Ore produces Ender Slurry  
Crushing Blaze Ore produces Blaze Slurry

Washing slurry produces 2 dust of the corresponding type.  
Smelting or blasting dust produces fragments.

This allows Silk Touch ore doubling and full automation.

---

## Crafting

- 9 Ender Fragments → 1 Ender Pearl
- 9 Blaze Fragments → 1 Blaze Powder
- 8 Ender Fragments + 1 Blaze Powder → 1 Eye of Ender

All smelting recipes work in furnaces and blast furnaces.

---

## Advancements

### Ender
- Fragmented Reality: Obtain Ender Fragments or Ender Ore
- Spontaneous Relocation: Eat an Ender Fragment and survive

### Blaze
- Hey Hot Stuff: Obtain Blaze Ore
- Now We’re Cooking: Obtain Blaze Slurry

---

## Peaceful Mode Friendly

This mod is designed so that every End and Blaze item can be obtained without killing hostile mobs. Mining, processing, and automation fully replace mob farms.
