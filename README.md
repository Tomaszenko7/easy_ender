# Easy Ender

Easy Ender is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds new ways to obtain Ender Pearls through mining, processing, and risky consumption.

Instead of relying on Endermen or trading, players can now mine Ender Ore, refine it into fragments, and craft or process their way to pearls.

---

## 🔮 New Ores

Easy Ender adds **three Ender Ores**:

| Ore | Where it spawns |
|------|----------------|
| **Ender Ore** | Overworld (Y -64 to 12) |
| **Deepslate Ender Ore** | Deepslate layer |
| **End Ender Ore** | The End (much more common) |

All variants:
- Require **Iron pickaxe or better**
- Support **Silk Touch**
- Emit a faint glow
- Drop **Ender Fragments**
- Give **XP** when mined

---

## 🧩 Ender Fragments

Ender Fragments are the core resource of the mod.

They are obtained by:
- Mining Ender Ore
- Smelting Ender Dust
- Smelting Ender Ore blocks

They can be:
- Crafted into Ender Pearls
- Consumed by the player (dangerous…)
- Used for modded automation (Create, etc)

---

## 🔨 Processing & Recipes

### Crafting

### Smelting
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Ender Dust | 1 Ender Fragment |
| Ender Ore | 1 Ender Fragment |
| Deepslate Ender Ore | 1 Ender Fragment |
| End Ender Ore | 1 Ender Fragment |

### Crushing & Milling (Create compatible)

If you use Create or other tech mods:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| Ender Ore | 2x Ender Dust |
| Ender Fragment | 1x Ender Dust |

This allows **ore doubling** when Silk Touched and processed.
